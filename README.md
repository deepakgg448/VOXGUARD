#VOXGUARD
VOXGUARD is an innovative privacy-first protocol designed to combat the growing threat of deep fake and AI voice scams by verifying a user's humanity through unique physical voice attributes rather than identity or spoken words. The core problem addressed is the ease with which sophisticated synthetic voices can bypass traditional authentication methods like SMS or 2FA, all while existing security solutions often demand a trade-off with user privacy through KYC or extensive data recording (p. 1).
** VOXGUARD offers a blockchain-anchored reputation layer that analyzes subtle voice patterns such as micro-jitter, breathing, phase noise, and rhythm shifts in real-time, converting this into a numerical vector (pp. 1-2). Crucially, no raw audio or personal identifiers like phone numbers are ever stored, preserving user anonymity (p. 2).
The technical solution is built on four key features: local voice analysis to produce a unique Voice Authenticity Vector (VAV); a cryptographic privacy layer that hashes the VAV using SHA-256 or Poseidon and links it to a temporary, anonymous wallet address; an on-chain reputation logic using smart contracts to track a dynamic trust score; and decentralized consensus (p. 2). This multi-source consensus mechanism (across user devices, enterprises, and future telecom validators) ensures the trust score is tamper-proof and resistant to manipulation or collusion (pp. 2-3). Users see simple trust indicators (High Trust, Unverified, Low Trust) which mask the underlying blockchain logic (p. 3).
VOXGUARD's unique value proposition lies in its pattern-based reputation system, which is portable across various platforms like banking apps and telecom services, meaning users only need to build their reputation once (p. 3). The system is transparent, user-controlled (users own their trust data on the blockchain), and provides real-time detection of potential AI voices, preventing harm before it occurs (p. 3). The tech stack utilizes modern tools including React Native/Flutter for the frontend, Node.js/Python for the backend/ML, Ethereum/Polygon for smart contracts, and WebRTC/ZK-proofs for connectivity and privacy (p. 3). This comprehensive approach offers a secure and private solution to an increasingly prevalent digital threat.
Used Thinkroot AI compilation to convert our idea to a real time application. This AI application helped us to create our project to model in a few minutes. After the prototype has some flaws, it has been enhanced using the enhance and fix a bug feature in the Thinkroot.
